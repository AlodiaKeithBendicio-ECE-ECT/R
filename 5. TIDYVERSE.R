# TIDYVERSE

# PACKAGES offer a helpful combination of code, reusable R functions,
# descriptive documentation, tests for checking operability, and sample datasets.

# TIDYVERSE (R) - a system of packages in R w/ a common design philosophy for
# data manipulation, exploration, and visualization

# CRAN makes sure any R content open to the public meets the required quality standards.

# install tidyverse package
install.packages("tidyverse")

# load the tidyverse library
library(tidyverse)
# 8 more packages are loaded too
# Conflicts happen when packages have functions with same names as other functions.
# the lase package loaded is the one whose functions will be used

# 8 CORE TIDYVERSE PACKAGES
  # 1. ggplot2 - data visualization
  # 2. tibble - data frames
  # 3. tidyr - data cleaning
  # 4. readr - importing data
  # 5. purrr - functions, vectors helping make code easier to write
  # 6. dplyr - common data manipulation tasks
  # 7. stringr - functions that make it easier to work w/ strings
  # 8. forcats - provides tools that solve common problems w/ factors
  
  # to get to the latest: tidyverse_update()
  # update all packages: Update.packages()
  # just update one package: Install.packages("package name")
  
# FOUR PACKAGES that are an essential part of the
  # WORKFLOW FOR DATA ANALYSTS:
  # 1. ggplot2 - data visualization, plots
  # 2. tidyr - data cleaning
  # 3. readr - importing data, read_csv
  # 4. dplyr - select, filter...
  
  # ggplot2 (R)
  # - create a variety of data viz by applying different
  #   visual properties to the data variables in R
  
  # tidyr (R)
  # - a package used for data cleaning
  # - to make tidy data
  
  # readr (R)
  # - used for importing data
  
  # dplyr (R)
  # - offers a consistent set of functions that help you
  #   complete some common data manipulation tasks

# FACTORS (R)
# - store categorical data in R where the data values are limited
#   and usually based on finite group (ex. country, year)
